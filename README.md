Project Title: Data Cleaning and Transformation Web App

Description:
The Data Cleaning and Transformation Web App is a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive data applications. This app allows users to upload a CSV dataset, perform various data cleaning and preprocessing operations, and then download the cleaned dataset. It is designed to simplify the process of preparing data for analysis or machine learning tasks.

Key Features:

Data Upload: Users can upload a CSV file containing their dataset directly through the app.

Data Cleaning Options: The app provides a range of data cleaning options, including:

Deleting specific columns: Users can select columns to be removed from the dataset.
Label encoding for categorical columns: Users can encode categorical data into numeric values, which is often necessary for machine learning.
Converting label-encoded data back to categorical: Users can revert previously encoded categorical data to its original form.
Additional data cleaning options (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates) can be added as needed.
Data Visualization: Users can explore their data through basic data visualizations such as histograms for numeric columns.

Data Export: Once data cleaning operations are complete, users can download the cleaned dataset in CSV format.

User Instructions: The app provides clear instructions to guide users through the data cleaning process.

Benefits:

Simplifies the data cleaning and preprocessing process for users, saving them time and effort.
Enhances data quality and consistency, making it more suitable for analysis or machine learning.
Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface, reducing the need for users to write code for data cleaning.
Use Cases:

Data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners can use this app to quickly prepare their datasets for analysis or modeling.
Researchers and students can use it to clean and transform data for academic projects and research.
Any user with a CSV dataset in need of cleaning or preprocessing can benefit from the app's simplicity and efficiency.
